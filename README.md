Back in 2016, I wanted to try my hand at an iPhone app.  Decided on helping out a small local accapella group that I liked called Eh440.

Eventually it stopped working through Apple's many swift update cycles.  As the band broke up, there was no reason to spend time on it.

Posted here for posterity.  Looking back it, it sure needs a lot of work.  Maybe one day.
